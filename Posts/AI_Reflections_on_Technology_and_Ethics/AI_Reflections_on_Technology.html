<p>AI has become an incredibly popular topic in today's world. Its growth and impact have been so remarkable that it has created numerous job opportunities across various industries. The quick arrival of new technologies often amazes us and makes us think about their impact.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I had the chance to use a computer. I was in standard 2 at school, and it opened up a world of endless possibilities. The mere thought of understanding everything that was happening inside that machine sparked a deep curiosity within me.</p>
<p>A year later, luckily my father bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>. This portable gaming console became a gateway to a world of video games, and I have been fascinated by them for a long time and I still am. Playing video games has brought me a lot of joy and excitement, and it has greatly influenced my interests and hobbies up until now.</p>
<p>Recently, I played a game all about the year 2038, portraying a future where robots have taken over most of the work, from assisting in homes to working in police investigations. However, this advancement in robotics created a divide among the jobless population, leading to feelings of hatred, depression, and substance abuse.</p>
<p>In this game, the robots, particularly the Detroit model, had become highly intelligent. Sadly, because they were treated badly and abused by their owners, they began to fight back by causing harm to their owners and sometimes even causing their deaths. While we might perceive this as an act of intelligence, it was seen as a virus in that situation. The robots demanded recognition and rights, spreading this notion to other robots manufactured by the company '<a href="https://www.quanticdream.com/en/detroit-become-human">Android- Detroit</a>'.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence undoubtedly has the potential to make human work easier and faster, but it is crucial that we use it wisely. It's important to consider the consequences and ethical implications of our actions. In the game I played, the robots were operated with a specialized fluid known as "blue blood," which cost significantly less than the expenses incurred by companies like <a href="https://openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, which has to pay millions of Indian Rupees daily for its maintenance.</p>
<p>This example serves as a reminder that while AI can bring about remarkable advancements, we should exercise caution and responsibility in its implementation. By doing this, we can make sure that we use artificial intelligence in a way that is helpful and safe, while also reducing any possible problems or unexpected results.</p>
